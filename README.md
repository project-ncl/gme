# Introduction

This is a Gradle tool to align versions and dependencies within the project according to some external references. It excels in a cleanroom environment where large numbers of pre-existing projects must be rebuilt. It is a sibling project to the [Maven POM Manipulator Extension](https://github.com/release-engineering/pom-manipulation-ext).

# Plugins

Both plugins work in conjunction and therefore the same version is required for each. The analyzer plugin will inject a reference
to the manipulation plugin. It requires Gradle 5.6.x - 6.x to _build_ and can _run_ with Gradle 4.10.x - 6.x.

## Analyzer

The `analyzer` directory contains the gradle plugin that generates metadata information about aligned dependencies and the project version.

Latest version of the Analyzer init script : https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jboss/gm/analyzer/2.7/analyzer-2.7-init.gradle


## Manipulation

The `manipulation` directory contains the gradle plugin that uses the metadata information generated by the `alignment` plugin and
modifies the project to use those dependencies and project version.
